# Overview

This is a Discord bot application built with discord.py that implements a voting-based server opening system. The bot allows server administrators to create interactive voting sessions where users can vote to "unlock" a server by reaching a minimum vote threshold. When the threshold is met, the bot reveals a server code to all participants.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Bot Framework
- **Technology**: discord.py library with slash commands (app_commands)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Event-driven bot with command handlers
- **Intents**: Uses default Discord intents for basic functionality
- **Command Prefix**: "!" (though the bot appears designed primarily for slash commands)

## State Management
- **In-Memory Storage**: Uses a Python dictionary (`aperturas`) to track active voting sessions
- **Session Data Structure**: Each session stores:
  - `votos_actuales`: Current vote count
  - `votos_minimo`: Required votes to unlock
  - `codigo`: Server code to reveal
  - `mensaje`: Reference to the original Discord message
  - `abierto`: Boolean flag indicating if threshold was reached
- **Rationale**: Simple in-memory storage is sufficient for temporary voting sessions that don't require persistence across bot restarts
- **Limitation**: All voting session data is lost if the bot restarts

## User Interface Components
- **Discord UI Framework**: Uses discord.ui for interactive components
- **Custom View**: `VotarView` class implements a persistent button-based voting interface
- **Timeout Behavior**: `timeout=None` ensures voting buttons remain active indefinitely
- **Interaction Model**: 
  - Users click a button to vote
  - Ephemeral responses confirm individual votes privately
  - Public embed updates show progress to all users
  - Final reveal happens in the channel when threshold is met

## Embed Design
- **Progress Tracking**: Embeds display vote progress (current/required format)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Embeds are edited in-place as votes come in
- **Final Reveal**: Special embed with server code is posted when voting completes

## Concurrency Considerations
- **Problem**: Multiple simultaneous votes could cause race conditions
- **Current Approach**: Simple increment operation on vote counter
- **Potential Issue**: No locking mechanism to prevent concurrent vote counting errors
- **Trade-off**: Acceptable for small-scale usage, may need revision for high-traffic scenarios

# External Dependencies

## Discord.py Library
- **Purpose**: Core bot functionality, slash commands, UI components
- **Key Modules Used**:
  - `discord.app_commands`: Slash command framework
  - `discord.ext.commands`: Bot command infrastructure
  - `discord.ui`: Interactive UI components (Views, Buttons)
  - `discord.Intents`: Permission system for bot capabilities

## Environment Variables
- **DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN**: Discord bot authentication token (stored securely in Replit Secrets)
- **Access Pattern**: `os.getenv()` to retrieve token from environment
- **Security**: Token is never exposed in code, stored only in environment

## Discord API
- **Integration Type**: Full Discord bot integration
- **Key Features Used**:
  - Message embeds
  - Interactive buttons
  - Ephemeral messages (private responses)
  - Message editing
  - Channel messaging
